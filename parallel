  11: BUTCHERING THE HUMAN CARCASS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
  12:    
  13: by Bob Arson
  14: 
  15: This is a step-by-step guide on how to break down the human body from
  16:    the full figure into serviceable choice cuts of meat. As in any field,
  17:    there are a number of methods to the practice, and you may wish to
  18:    view this as a set of suggestions rather than concrete rules. You will
  19:    notice that the carving of the larger or "commercial" cuts down into
  20:    smaller specific or "retail" cuts will be only mentioned in passing,
  21:    and not concentrated upon. Also, the use of human fat and viscera is
  22:    generally avoided, and left only to the most experimental chef. These
  23:    choices, along with recipes and serving suggestions, are nearly
  24:    infinite in variety, and we leave them to you. We've found these
  25:    guidelines to be simple and functional, but recognize that there is
  26:    always room for improvement and we welcome your suggestions.
  27:    
  28: Before getting to the main task, it must be mentioned that the
  29:    complete rendering of the human carcass requires a fairly large amount
  30:    of time, effort, and space. If the consumer does not wish to go
  31:    through the ordeal of processing and storing the bulk of the entire
  32:    animal, an easy alternative is as follows. Simply saw through one or
  33:    both legs at the points directly below the groin and a few inches
  34:    above the knee. Once skinned, these portions may then be cut into
  35:    round steaks of the carver's preferred thickness, cut into fillets,  
  36:    deboned for a roast, etc. Meat for several meals is thus readily      
  37:    obtained without the need for gutting and the complexities of     
  38:    preparing the entire form.
  39:    
  40: The human being (also referred to throughout culinary history as "long
  41:    pig" and "hairless goat" in the case of younger specimens) is not   
  42:    thought of as a staple food source. Observing the anatomy  
  43:    and skeleton, one can see that the animal is neither built nor bred
  44:    for its meat, and as such will not provide nearly as much flesh as a
  45:    pig or cow (for example, an average 1000 pound steer breaks down to
  46:    provide 432 pounds of saleable beef). The large central pelvis and
  47:    broad shoulder blades also interfere with achieving perfect cuts.
  48:    There are advantages to this however, especially due to the fact that
  49:    the typical specimen will weigh between 100-200 pounds, easily        
  50:    manipulated by one person with sufficient leverage.            
  51:    
  52: Here the caution in choosing your meal must be mentioned. It is VERY
  53:    IMPORTANT to remember that animals raised for slaughter are kept in
  54:    tightly controlled environments with their health and diet carefully
  55:    maintained. Humans are not. Thus not only is the meat of each person
  56:    of varying quality, but people are also subject to an enormous range
  57:    of diseases, infections, chemical imbalances, and poisonous bad
  58:    habits, all typically increasing with age. Also as an animal ages, the
  59:    meat loses its tenderness, becoming tough and stringy. No farm animal
  60:    is ever allowed to age for thirty years. Six to thirteen months old is
  61:    a more common slaughtering point. You will obviously want a youthful
  62:    but mature physically fit human in apparently good health. A certain
  63:    amount of fat is desirable as "marbling" to add a juicy, flavorful 
  64:    quality to the meat. We personally prefer firm caucasian females in 
  65:    their early twenties. These are "ripe". But tastes vary, and it is a
  66:    very large herd.
  67:    
  68: The butcher will need a fairly roomy space in which to work (an      
  69:    interior location is suggested), and a large table for a butcher's
  70:    block. A central overhead support will need to be chosen or installed
  71:    ahead of time to hang the carcass from. Large tubs or barrels for
  72:    blood and waste trimmings should be convenient, and a water source  
  73:    close by. Most of the work can be done with a few simple tools: sharp,
  74:    clean short and long bladed knives, a cleaver or hatchet, and a     
  75:    hacksaw.
  76:    
  77: Body Preparation: Acquiring your subject is up to you. For best
  78:    results and health, freshness is imperative. A living human in        
  79:    captivity is optimal, but not always available. When possible make   
  80:    sure the animal has no food for 48 hours, but plenty of water. This   
  81:    fasting helps flush the system, purging stored toxins and bodily    
  82:    wastes, as well as making bleeding and cleaning easier. Under ideal 
  83:    conditions, the specimen will then be stunned into insensitivity. 
  84:    Sharp unexpected blows to the head are best, tranquilizers not being
  85:    recommended as they may taint the flavor of the meat. If this is not
  86:    possible without exciting the animal and causing a struggle (which
  87:    will pump a greater volume of blood and secretions such as adrenaline
  88:    throughout the body), a single bullet through the middle of the
  89:    forehead or back of the skull will suffice.
  90:    
  91: Hanging: Once the animal is unconscious or dead, it is ready to be
  92:    hoisted. Get the feet up first, then the hands, with the head down.
  93:    This is called the "Gein configuration". Simple loops of rope may be  
  94:    tied around the hands and feet and then attached to a crossbar or
  95:    overhead beam. Or, by making a cut behind the Achilles tendon, a
  96:    meathook may be inserted into each ankle for hanging support. The legs
  97:    should be spread so that the feet are outside the shoulders, with the
  98:    arms roughly parallel to the legs. This provides access to the pelvis,
  99:    and keeps the arms out of the way in a ready position for removal.
 100:    It's easiest to work if the feet are slightly above the level of the
 101:    butcher's head.
 102: Bleeding: Place a large open vessel beneath the animal's head. With a
 103:    long-bladed knife, start at one corner of the jaw and make a deep   
 104:    "ear-to-ear" cut through the neck and larynx to the opposite side.  
 105:    This will sever the internal and external carotid arteries, the major
 106:    blood vessels carrying blood from the heart to the head, face, and   
 107:    brain. If the animal is not yet dead, this will kill it quickly, and
 108:    allow for the blood to drain in any case. After the initial rush of
 109:    blood, the stream should be controllable and can be directed into a
 110:    receptacle. Drainage can be assisted by massaging the extremities down
 111:    in the direction of the trunk, and by compressing and releasing,   
 112:    "pumping", the stomach. A mature specimen will contain almost six   
 113:    liters of blood. There is no use for this fluid, unless some source is
 114:    waiting to use it immediately for ritual purposes. It acts as an
 115:    emetic in most people if drunk, and it must be mentioned here that    
 116:    because of the eternal possibility of AIDS it is recommended that for
 117:    safety's sake all blood should be considered to be contaminated and   
 118:    disposed of in some fashion. It is not known whether an HlV-infected
 119:    human's flesh is dangerous even if cooked, but this is another item to
 120:    consider when choosing a specimen, someone in the low-risk strata.
 121: Beheading: When the bleeding slows, preparation for decapitation can 
 122:    be started. Continue the cut to the throat around the entire neck,
 123:    from the jawline to the back of the skull. Once muscle and ligament
 124:    have been sliced away, the head can be cleanly removed by gripping it
 125:    on either side and twisting it off, separation occurring where the
 126:    spinal cord meets the skull. This is indicative of the method to be 
 127:    used for dividing other bones or joints, in that the meat should   
 128:    generally be cut through first with a knife, and the exposed bone then
 129:    separated with a saw or cleaver. The merits of keeping the skull as a 
 130:    trophy are debatable for two principal reasons. First, a human skull
 131:    may call suspicious attention to the new owner. Secondly, thorough
 132:    cleaning is difficult due to the large brain mass, which is hard to   
 133:    remove without opening the skull. The brain is not good to eat. 
 134:    Removing the tongue and eyes, skinning the head, and placing it   
 135:    outside in a wire cage may be effective. The cage allows small       
 136:    scavengers such as ants and maggots to cleanse the flesh from the  
 137:    bones, while preventing it being carried off by larger scavengers,  
 138:    such as dogs and children. After a sufficient period of time, you may 
 139:    retrieve the skull and boil it in a dilute bleach solution to     
 140:    sterilize it and wash away any remaining tissue.
 141: Skinning: After removing the head, wash the rest of the body down.
 142:    Because there is no major market for human hides, particular care in
 143:    removing the skin in a single piece is not necessary, and makes the  
 144:    task much easier. The skin is in fact a large organ, and by flaying
 145:    the carcass you not only expose the muscular configuration, but also
 146:    get rid of the hair and the tiny distasteful glands which produce
 147:    sweat and oil. A short-bladed knife should be used to avoid slicing   
 148:    into muscle and viscera. The skin is composed of two layers, an outer
 149:    thinner one with a thicker tissue layer below it. When skinning, first
 150:    score the surface, cutting lightly to be sure of depth and direction.
 151:    The diagram of the skinning pattern is an example of strip-style   
 152:    skinning, dividing the surface into portions easy to handle. Reflect
 153:    the skin by lifting up and peeling back with one hand, while bringing
 154:    the knife in as flat to the skin as possible to cut away connective
 155:    tissue. The external genitals present only a small obstacle. In the
 156:    male the penis and scrotum can be pulled away from the body and   
 157:    severed, in the female the outer lips skinned as the rest of the body.
 158:    It is important to leave the anus untouched at this point, and a
 159:    circle of skin should be left around it. You need not bother skinning
 160:    the hands and feet, these portions not being worth the effort unless
 161:    you plan to pickle them or use them in soup. The skin can be disposed
 162:    of, or made into fried rinds. Boil the strips and peel away the outer
 163:    layer, then cut into smaller pieces and deep-fat fry in boiling oil
 164:    until puffy and crisp. Dust with garlic salt, paprika and cayenne  
 165:    pepper.
 166: Gutting: The next major step is complete evisceration of the carcass.
 167:    To begin, make a cut from the solar plexus, the point between the    
 168:    breastbone and stomach, almost to the anus. Be very careful not to cu
 169:    into the intestines, as this will contaminate the surrounding area   
 170:    with bacteria and possibly feces (if this does happen, cleanse  
 171:    thoroughly). A good way to avoid this is to use the knife inside the
 172:    abdominal wall, blade facing toward you, and making cautious progress.
 173:    
 174: 
 175: Make a cut around the anus, or "bung", and tie it off with twine. This
 176:    also prevents contamination, keeping the body from voiding any        
 177:    material left in the bowel. With a saw, cut through the pubic bone, or
 178:    "aitch". The lower body is now completely open, and you can begin to 
 179:    pull the organ masses (large and small intestines, kidneys, liver,  
 180:    stomach) out and cut them away from the back wall of the body.       
 181:    
 182: For the upper torso, first cut through the diaphragm around the inner
 183:    surface of the carcass. This is the muscular membrane which divides
 184:    the upper, or thoracic, and the lower abdominal cavities. Remove the
 185:    breastbone, cutting down to the point on each side where it connects
 186:    to the ribs, and then sawing through and detaching it from the collar
 187:    bone. Some prefer to cut straight through the middle, depending on the
 188:    ideas you have for cuts in the final stages. The heart and lungs may  
 189:    be detached and the throat cut into to removlarynx and trachea.
 190:    Once all of the inner organs have been removed, trim away any blood
 191:    vessels or remaining pieces of connective tissue from the interior of
 192:    the carcass, and wash out thoroughly.
 193: 
 194:    Remove the Arms: Actual butchering of the carcass is now ready to
 195:    begin. Cut into the armpit straight to the shoulder, and remove the   
 196:    arm bone, the humerus, from the collar bone and shoulder blade. Chop
 197:    the hand off an inch or so above the wrist. Most of the meat here is  
 198:    between elbow and shoulder, as the muscle groups are larger here and
 199:    due to the fact that there are two bones in the forearm. Another way
 200:    of cutting this portion is to cut away the deltoid muscle from the
 201:    upper arm near the shoulder (but leaving it attached to the trunk)
 202:    before removing the limb. This decreases the percentage of useable   
 203:    meat on the arm, but allows a larger shoulder strip when excising the
 204:    shoulder blade. Purely a matter of personal preference. Cut into and
 205:    take apart the joint of the elbow, and the two halves of each arm are
 206:    now ready for carving servings from. Human flesh should always be    
 207:    properly cooked before eating.
 208:    
 209: Halving the Carcass: The main body is now ready to be split. Some like
 210:    to saw straight through the spine from buttocks to neck. This leaves
 211:    the muscle fiber encasing the vertebrae on the end of the ribs. The  
 212:    meat here however is tightly wrapped about the bone, and we find it
 213:    more suitable (if used at all) when boiled for soup. Thus, our
 214:    preferred method is to completely remove the entire backbone by  
 215:    cutting and then sawing down either side from the tailbone on through.
 216:    
 217: 
 218: Quartering the Carcass: The halves may now be taken down, unless your
 219:    preparation table or butcher block is very short. This is inadequate,
 220:    and you will have to quarter while hanging, slicing through the side
 221:    at a point of your choosing between rib cage and pelvis. Now is also
 222:    the time to begin thinking about how you would like to serve the  
 223:    flesh, as this will determine the style of cuts you are about to make.
 224:    These will also be greatly affected by the muscular configuration   
 225:    (physical fitness) of your specimen. First, chop the feet off at a    
 226:    point about three inches up from the ankle. The bones are very thick
 227:    where the leg connects to the foot. You will want to divide the side
 228:    of meat into two further principal portions: the ribs and shoulder,
 229:    and the half-pelvis and leg. In between is the "flank" or belly, which
 230:    may be used for fillets or steaks, if thick enough, or even bacon   
 231:    strips if you wish to cut this thinly. Thin and wide strips of flesh
 232:    may also be rolled, and cooked to serve as a roast. Trim away along
 233:    the edge of the ribs, and then decide whether you will cut steaks from
 234:    the flank into the thighs and rump, and carve accordingly.     
 235:    
 236: Cutting the Top Quarter: Although not actually 25% of the meat you
 237:    will get, this is designated as one-fourth of the carcass as divided
 238:    into major portions. You may trim away the neck, or leave it to be   
 239:    connected with the shoulder, or "chuck". The first major step with   
 240:    this mass is to remove the shoulder blade and the collar bone. The  
 241:    best and easiest way we have found is to just cut along the outline of
 242:    shoulder blade, removing the meat on top and then dislocating the
 243:    large bone. To excise the collar bone make an incision along its      
 244:    length and then cut and pry it away. Depending upon the development of
 245:    the breast, you may decide it qualifies as a "brisket" and remove it
 246:    before cutting the ribs. In the female the breast is composed largely
 247:    of glands and fatty tissue, and despite its appetizing appearance is
 248:    rather inedible. The ribs are the choice cut of the quarter. An    
 249:    perennial favorite for barbecuing, you may divide into sections of    
 250:    several ribs each and cook them as is, divide the strip in half for
 251:    shorter ribs, or even carve rib steaks if the muscle mass is        
 252:    sufficient. 
 253:    
 254: Cutting the Lower Quarter: This is where most of the meat is, humans
 255:    being upright animals. The muscle mass is largest in the legs and
 256:    rump. The bulk is so comparatively large here that you can do just
 257:    about anything with it. The main pieces are the buttock or rump and 
 258:    the upper leg, the thigh. Our typical division is to cut the leg off
 259:    at the bottom of the buttock, then chop away the bony mass of the 
 260:    knee, at places two to three inches away in either direction. Before
 261:    doing this, however, you may want to remove the whole calf muscle from
 262:    back of the lower leg, as this is the best cut in its area. The  
 263:    upper leg is now ready for anything, most especially some beautiful,
 264:    thick round steaks. The rump will have to be carved from the pelvis in
 265:    a rather triangular piece. The legs attach at the hip at a forward  
 266:    point on the body, so there will be little interference as you carve 
 267:    along the curve of the pelvis. Remaining meat will be on the thighs in
 268:    front of the pelvis. 
 269:    
 270: And that's basically it. An average freezer provides plenty of storage
 271:    space, or you may even wish to build a simple old-fashioned smokehouse
 272:    (just like an outhouse, with a stone firepit instead of a shitter).
 273:    Offal and other waste trimmings can be disposed of in a number of
 274:    ways, burial, animal feed, and puree and flush being just a few. Bones
 275:    will dry and become brittle after being baked an oven, and can be
 276:    pulverized.

  15: 
  16: I have to agree with Martin in that I've not heard of this before
  17: either, but I have seen claims to the opposite.  In a trivial
  18: sense, of course more omnivores incur B12 deficiency problems
  19: simply because there are more of them.  Of course, this is not
  20: what is at issue.  What we need are accurate incidence rates (and
  21: ideally breakdowns of the various causes of B12 deficiency) and
  22: this would require very large samples of people.
  23: 
  24: 
  25: FACTORS THAT AFFECT DIETARY B12 NEEDS
  26: 
  27: Of course, maybe we need to qualify which "vegans" are clearly at
  28: risk and which one's might "theoretically" be at risk.  First,
  29: consider some of the factors that are known to increase one's
  30: need for B12:
  31: 
  32:      (1). Meat or other animal products and refined carbohydrates
  33:           (sugars) when used generously may more than double B12
  34:           needs.
  35: 
  36:      (2).  Persons who use drugs, chemical, or beverages which
  37:           destroy B12 (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, etc.)
  38: 
  39:      (3).  Megadoses of vitamin C may produce B12 deficiency by
  40:           destroying the cobalamins during transport through the
  41:           gastrointestinal tract (Hines, 1975).  Quantities more
  42:           than 1/2 of a gram can destroy 50% to 95% of B12 in
  43:           the food.
  44: 
  45:      (4).  Oral contraceptives are used (affects the B12 binders
  46:           of the blood).
  47: 
  48:      (5).  egg albumin and egg yolk decreases B12 absorption
  49: 
  50:      (6) intestinal parasitism (e.g., tapeworms) and explosively
  51:          growing bacterial floras can effectively compete with
  52:          the host for the vitamin
  53: 
  54: Given these factors that do increase need, it is apparent that
  55: meat eaters do need more B12, but presumably this is adequately
  56: compensated for by the fact that they consume more dietary B12.
  57: It is of course possible that the compensation may not be great
  58: enough.  Rather than only speculate, however, upon a
  59: "theoretical" deficiency, it would be best to have in hand some
  60: actual actuarial data documenting from large samples the relative
  61: rates of B12 deficiency disease among omnivores as compared to
  62: vegans.  So far, I've not seen any such actuarial data compiled.
  63: But this is understandable when we keep in mind that B12
  64: deficiency is actually rare and of the cases occurring 95% of
  65: those cases are not due to a simple dietary deficiency but rather
  66: to physiological absorption/utilization problems.
  67: 
  68: 
  69: B12 DEFICIENCY AMONG VEGAN INFANTS AND CHILDREN
  70: 
  71: There are, however, amply studies (see Chanarin et al., 1985;
  72: Dagnelie et al, 1989a; Dagnelie, 1989b) upon some groups of
  73: vegans whose young  children and infants are documented to show
  74: an higher than expected incidence of the signs and symptoms of
  75: B12 deficiency (see references below).  This concern for the
  76: children of some fad vegetarians that should be seriously noted.
  77: There is enough evidence (see references below) to here warrant
  78: concern that some vegan groups do incur a risk of B12 deficiency
  79: among their young children.  In particular, vegetarian groups
  80: prone to certain "fad" vegetarianism like that of macrobiotic or
  81: crudivore diets, seem to sometimes (again, not consistently) have
  82: a higher incidence of B12 deficiencies among their young
  83: children.
  84: 
  85: Why certain vegetarian diets or practices seem to incur this
  86: problem is not yet understood.  The heavy use of nori, for
  87: instance, could be one explanation.  The problem with algae
  88: sources like spirulina or nori is not only that they are low in
  89: what is being NOW measured as B12 by newer methods (see Herbert,
  90: 1988) but that it may not be a true B12 but possibly contains
  91: what has been referred to as noncobalamin analogues of B12 that
  92: might actually interfere with the absorption of true B12.  In any
  93: case, "B12" from spirulina or nori, if it is true B12, is simply
  94: NOT bioavailable (see Dagnelie, 1991).  Another possible
  95: explanation would be the "explosive" growing of bacterial floras
  96: that can be stimulated by certain very high fiber diets (which
  97: would characterized the extreme macrobiotic diets of eating only
  98: cereals, particularly rice, which are high in the slowly
  99: fermentable fibers that most readily promote microbe
 100: proliferation)
 101: 
 102: In any case, to err on the side of caution, certainly lactating
 103: vegetarian women and young vegan children should certainly take
 104: some supplements.  The Nutrition Standing Committee of the
 105: British Paediatric Assoc recommended in its special report on
 106: vegetarian weaning (ARCHIVES OF DIS. IN CHILDHOOD, 1988,
 107: 63:1286), for instance, recommended B12 supplements at weaning
 108: and for breast feeding vegan mothers.
 109: 
 110: 
 111: RECOMMENDED AMOUNTS OF B12
 112: 
 113: Now, before we consider the more controversial question about
 114: whether or not adult vegans have an higher incidence of B12
 115: deficiency disease than omnivores, it might be helpful to keep in
 116: mind some of what is known about about B12 needs.
 117: 
 118: Now, the amount of B12 actually needed by the body is incredibly
 119: small and the RDA level is of course more than you need, due to
 120: considerations for a safety margin but also because of the
 121: measurement problem for small amounts of B12 and the consequent
 122: assessment of now much B12 is really necessary for human beings.
 123: The National Research Council recommends 3 micrograms (3
 124: millionths of a gram) per day to meet the body's needs.  Victor
 125: Herbert, who is probably the leading authority on B12, suggests
 126: that 1 microgram would be a better RDA, and he puts the actual
 127: requirements of *absorbed* B12 to be round .1 microgram/day
 128: (hence, the NRC recommendation may in practice be some to 6 to 30
 129: times greater than our actual requirement).
 130: 
 131: Absorption of the vitamin also decreases with increased intake.
 132: At low levels of intake the mean absorption is 70% (even higher
 133: for people with low serum levels of B12), but at high intake
 134: levels the absorption rate drops to about 16%.
 135: 
 136: The fact of the matter is that you need very little and your body
 137: can store the stuff for 3 to 5 years.  Hence, you simply don't
 138: need to consume B12 every day.  Another point maybe to keep in
 139: mind is that researchers really don't know how much low levels of
 140: B12 is in our foodstuffs since their is not yet a sensitive
 141: enough  assay for trace amounts of B12.
 142: 
 143: The main rout of loss of bodily B12 in the bile, while most of
 144: the bile is effectively reabsorbed (more than 90%), some is not
 145: thereby making for a loss of B12 (about .1 microgram/day).
 146: Because vegans generally eat less fat and no cholesterol, their
 147: production of bile is less and it is therefore likely that their
 148: need for B12 replacement would also be less.
 149: 
 150: 
 151: VEGAN  SOURCES OF B12
 152: 
 153: It is true that cultured sources may have little or no
 154: B12, but this depends on the culturing process.  Nutritional
 155: yeast, for instance, if cultured under controlled conditions
 156: so stringently that no bacteria is allowed to grow
 157: along with the yeast, then indeed there will be no B12, since the
 158: only source in nature is from bacteria  (incidentally, I have
 159: been told that the gene for B12 from bacteria could theoretically
 160: be cloned onto nutritional yeast so that we could then not only a
 161: tasty yeast but one with more than enough B12).  Some nutritional
 162: yeasts, may use a B12 rich feed for the yeast, in which case the
 163: yeast would then be a good source of B12.
 164: 
 165: It has been reported that B12 is to be found on the roots and
 166: stems of tomatoes, cabbage, celery, kale, broccoli, and leeks.
 167: Victor Herbert, however, found that "well washed" plant foods
 168: contain no B12 except for trace amounts in some rhibozium-
 169: bacteria-containing root nodules.
 170: 
 171: Some recent dietary intake studies of vegans showed them to be
 172: consuming, (including B12 from fortified foods like certain soya
 173: milks and margarines) an average intake of 1.2 -1.8 micrograms
 174: (Carlson et al., 1985; Sanders et al., 1987; Rana et. al.).  In a
 175: Swedish study where fortified foods were not used, the average
 176: intake of .35 micrograms was recorded (Abdulla et al., 1981).
 177: Gill Langely (1988), in his fine survey of the research on vegan
 178: nutrition, reports a study indicating British vegan pre-school
 179: children had a mean intake of 280% of the British RDA (but 5 did
 180: have intakes less than the recommended intake (Sanders, 1981).
 181: An U.S. vegan community that used supplemented soya milk and
 182: yeast, had mean intakes of 15 micrograms or about 660% of US RDA
 183: for children.  In none of the above groups were any clinical
 184: signs of deficiency found.
 185: 
 186: Maybe a more important consideration than what is to be found in
 187: our foods is that much vitamin B12 is actually produced by the
 188: body itself.  Bacterial flora in the gut, but also bacterial
 189: growth in the mouth, around the teeth and gums, in the
 190: nasopharynx, around the tonsils and tonsillar cypts (another
 191: reason not to remove tonsils if possible), in the folds at the
 192: base of the tongue and even in the upper bronchial tree can
 193: produce B12.
 194: 
 195: It is known that the B12 is produced in huge amounts in the colon
 196: (5.0 micrograms/day), though it doesn't seem that it can be
 197: absorbed through the walls of the colon.  The small intestine,
 198: however, can absorb B12 and indeed some B12 producing bacteria is
 199: to be found there.  It is possible that enough intrinsic factor
 200: enters the small intestine still sufficiently active to bond with
 201: B12 for absorption. It is also possible that vegan physiology
 202: enables a more ready absorption (or lower need?), than
 203: theoretically expected.  Who knows?  What we do know that
 204: people's ability to absorb many nutrients increases as one's need
 205: for those nutrients increases.  For example:
 206: 
 207:      ". . . vegetarians appear to "undergo physiological
 208:      adaptation enabling them to make somewhat better utilization
 209:      of iron than would be expected from iron bioavailability
 210:      studies involving the feeding of vegetarian diets to
 211:      omnivores or involving the testing of particular components
 212:      characteristic of vegetarian diets with omnivore subjects."
 213:           (from Kies & McEndree "Vegetarianism and the
 214:            bioavailability of iron" in Kies (ed.) NUTRITIONAL
 215:            BIOAVAILABILITY OF IRON, 1982).
 216: 
 217: Hence, we must exert some caution in extrapolating the
 218: nutritional needs and adaptive capacities of omnivores to that of
 219: vegans.  Better, therefore, to look at the DIRECT evidence of
 220: vegan health or deficiency.
 221: 
 222: 
 223: ARE ADULT VEGANS AT A GREATER RISK OF B12 DEFICIENCY?
 224: 
 225: Vegetarians who are not vegans but still consume milk products
 226: and eggs, probably not need to worry about B12 deficiencies.
 227: 
 228: Indeed, it is not evident that sensible adult vegans actually
 229: suffer from a greater incidence of B12 deficiency than do
 230: omnivores.  If one eats a variety of food products, consumes
 231: fresh vegetables and is not on antibiotics, then the B12 being
 232: produced by bacteria in the gut and the trace amounts from foods
 233: may well be sufficient.  The direct evidence for this comes from
 234: those studies that have actually tested vegans to see if B12
 235: deficiencies turn up.  In general, the results uniformly indicate
 236: that even in the case of those vegans who for decades have not
 237: taken any supplements they still appear to have adequate B12
 238: levels.  While the serum levels of B12 tend to be lower than that
 239: of an omnivorous control group, hematologic evidence of vitamin
 240: B12 deficiency is not present.
 241: 
 242: As Gill Langely reports:
 243: 
 244:     Accepted normal serum levels fall within a wide range -- from
 245:     100-900 pg/ml.  Values below 80pg/ml suggest a possible
 246:     deficiency of B12 while between 80 and 140pg/ml there may or
 247:     may not be symptoms of deficiency.  LOWER THAN NORMAL SERUM
 248:     LEVELS OF THE VITAMIN ARE NOT, OF THEMSELVES, INDICATIVE OF A
 249:     DEFICIENCY.  As already mentioned, vegans of up to 20 years
 250:     standing with no obvious source of the vitamin in their diets
 251:     only very rarely have clinical symptoms of deficiency.
 252:     Although their serum level of B12 does fall over a number of
 253:     years it often stabilizes at about 100pg/ml.  Vegans who take
 254:     supplements or fortified foods generally have higher serum
 255:     levels of the vitamin, while VEGAN MACROBIOTICS OR SMOKERS
 256:     MAY BE PREDISPOSED TO B12 DEFICIENCY.
 257: 
 258:     Consequently, surveys of vegans document a wide variation of
 259:     serum levels of B12.  On report (Ellis, 1967) mentions values
 260:     between 30 and 650 pg/ml with a mean value (of 20 subjects)
 261:     of 236pg/ml, compared with a range of 120-740pg/ml and a mean
 262:     serum value of 441 pg/ml in matched omniovre control
 263:     subjects.  There was NO CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF B12 DEFICIENCY
 264:     EVEN IN THOSE VEGANS WITH THE LOWEST SERUM LEVELS, although
 265:     one 80-year-old subject who had been a vegan for only 2 years
 266:     had pernicious anemia.  Three vegans who had been on the diet
 267:     for 17 years without taking supplements were healthy, with
 268:     serum B12 levels of 150, 375 and 450pg/ml, and normal amounts
 269:     of haemoglobin in the blood.
 270: 
 271:     Haematological measurements (Sanders it al, 1978) of 34
 272:     vegans who had been on the diet for between one and 30 years
 273:     revealed a range of serum B12 levels from 94-675pg/ml -- all
 274:     ABOVE the value of 80pg/ml at which deficiency symptoms can
 275:     be expected.  The majority of subjects took B12 tablets or
 276:     food fortified with the vitamin, and those who did had higher
 277:     amounts in their blood.  THE SERUM LEVELS OF THREE SUBJECTS
 278:     WHO HAD BEEN VEGAN FOR 6-13 YEARS (LONG ENOUGH THEORETICALLY
 279:     TO EXHAUST LIVER STORES OF B12) WITH NO OBVIOUS DIETARY
 280:     SOURCE OF B12 WERE ALSO ADEQUATE, at 120-230pg/ml.  All the
 281:     vegans were healthy, none showed symptoms of B12 deficiency
 282:     and all had normal haemoglobin values.  The same report lists
 283:     other surveys of vegans which have failed to show symptoms of
 284:     dietary deficiency of B12.  [emphasis his]
 285: 
 286: 
 287: 
 288: Given what conservative authorities have to say in theory about
 289: B12 (especially those that would undertake an analysis of the
 290: composition of a vegetarian diet), we should expect to see a
 291: greater incidence of B12 deficiency in vegans than in non-vegans,
 292: yet there is no such difference as far as I know.
 293: 
 294: Of course, people will cite some case studies of some unfortunate
 295: vegans but such case studies are limited in that we don't have a
 296: proper comparison with non-vegans and by now it should be
 297: apparent that many other causes besides dietary deficiency can be
 298: at fault.  If one looks at these case studies closely, the
 299: individuals are often reported as having other deficiencies
 300: thereby undermining the very point that such cases might thought
 301: to have illustrated in the first place.
 302: 
 303: What is interesting is that B12 is so extremely rare that even
 304: single case studies get published, but the generalizability of
 305: such case-studies to the general population of vegans is not to
 306: automatically be undertaken.  More evidence than this is needed,
 307: especially when the confound of physiological
 308: aborption/utilization problems are often not properly ruled out
 309: in these case studies.
 310: 
 311: 
 312: CAUSE FOR VEGAN PANIC?
 313: 
 314: Let it again be said, however, that B12 deficiency is "rare"
 315: among vegans and that over 95% of deficiency problems are not due
 316: to a simple intake inadequacy but are due to an malabsorption
 317: problem.  the development of a serious B12 deficiency is not a
 318: simple or well understood matter but it is known that absorption
 319: and conservation of B12 in the body is more important than how
 320: much is to be found in the diet.
 321: 
 322: known causes of malabsorption are a lack of intrinsic factor
 323: (e.g., due to pernicious anemia, destruction of gastric mucosa,
 324: etc.), removal or disease of the second portion of the ileum,
 325: competition for B12 by microorganisms or intestinal parasites,
 326: toxic substances, etc.
 327: 
 328: beside malabsorption, there are also possible problems (see
 329: herbert, 1973) in utilization (e.g., enzyme deficiencies, liver
 330: or kidney disease, etc), increase loss (e.g., renal disease) or
 331: for an increase requirement (e.g., hyperthyroidism, lactose
 332: intolerance).
 333: 
 334: still, if one has an absorption, loss, or increase need problem,
 335: then presumably when little B12 is available in the diet then
 336: still less is going to be assimilated.  now, what can vegans do
 337: to prevent a B12 deficiency?
 338: 
 339: 
 340: 
 341: HOW VEGANS MIGHT INCREASE THEIR B12 INTAKES
 342: 
 343: Fresh garden pricked vegetables, particularly root vegetables,
 344: that are not overly scrubbed cleaned or pealed will have some b-
 345: 12 on their surface.  Boiling such vegetables and then throwing
 346: out the water would make for a loss of this B12.
 347: 
 348: Since B12 is predominantly produced by bacteria (no animal
 349: produces its own), then foods grown in soils where the bacteria
 350: flora is rich would presumable have more B12 on their surface.
 351: Hence, organically grown foods will probably be richer in B12.
 352: 
 353: There is now some recent evidence (Combs, 1991) that some peas
 354: and bean actually produce their own B12.  It was previously
 355: thought that the only source in nature was bacteria.  This would
 356: suggest that such peas and beans would have their B12 throughout
 357: rather than just on the surface.  Still, this probably will not
 358: suffice as a single plant source to provide sufficient B12.
 359: 
 360: A simply but useful recommendation is to chew one's food properly
 361: and leave plenty of time between meals helps absorption.  The r-
 362: binders in saliva help to hold onto the B12 in the food until it
 363: reaches the small intestine where it absorbed (Fleming, 1978).
 364: 
 365: 
 366: TAKING SUPPLEMENTS.
 367: 
 368: Multivitamin preparations containing B12 is probably not a good
 369: idea.  Besides consuming so-called vitamin "d" which most people
 370: do not need and which has been implicated in helping to cause
 371: arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis, these preparations contain
 372: breakdown products of B12 that can actually have an anti-B12
 373: effect.  Hence, multivitamins may contribute to the very
 374: deficiency that they were supposed to correct.  Victor herbert
 375: (1962), the leading authority on B12, reported that all of the 10
 376: multivitamin-mineral products that he tested showed anti-B12
 377: breakdown products.  Tests for B12 in the blood unfortunately
 378: cannot discriminate between the true vitamin B12 and its
 379: breakdown products.
 380: 
 381: For healthy adult vegans I do think we should be careful about
 382: recommending routine B12 supplements.  Even though complete
 383: absorption is not likely, the dosages are probably still too high
 384: (1200 mcg).  There is some case studies and experimental evidence
 385: that an excessive B12 consumption encourages cell division in
 386: general and certain tumor cells in particular (bergevin et al.,
 387: 1976; chauvergne, 1970).
 388: 
 389: In general, use of B12 supplements should be certainly be
 390: considered by pregnant and lactating women, young infants and
 391: children, the elderly and vegans not in good health or who still
 392: smoke.  Serum levels of B12 are lower for smokers than non-
 393: smokers (this may be an effect of the cyanide content of tobacco
 394: smoke, which the body attempts to detoxify by a means that
 395: unfortunately uses up the stores of B12).
 396: 
 397: Non-smoking, healthy adult vegans who eat sensibly, are not on
 398: medications (e.g., antibiotics) and who do not daily drink
 399: alcohol probably do not need to take supplements.  If such vegans
 400: are going to take supplements, then they should probably not take
 401: them on regular basis since the doses are too high.
 402: 
 403: Individuals even on conventional diets (diets high in fat and
 404: animal protein which increase the need for B12) still only need
 405: about 1 mcg per day according to Victor Herbert (recent revision
 406: of RDA recommendations has lowered the amount from 3 mcg/day to 2
 407: mcg/day).  Maybe half of a typical 1000 mcg pill about once month
 408: would be more than sufficient.  Finally, vegans and non-vegans
 409: should make sure that their B12 supplements are derived from
 410: bacteria cultures and do not contain spirulina or nori.
 411: 
 412: If one has been a vegan for a many years, it might be a good idea
 413: to have one's serum B12 levels checked.  The normal range is
 414: about 150-750 pg/ml according to the merck manual.  Others put it
 415: at 100-900 pg/ml.  There is no exact cutoff.  Vegans, of course,
 416: will have levels at the low end but this by itself is not a cause
 417: for alarm.  After all, the "normal" range is based upon research
 418: from an omnivorous population and vegans do have a lower need for
 419: B12 and are more efficient at preservation of extant stores.
 420: indeed, it could be argued that the "true normal" range might
 421: well closer to that of vegans.  The "ideal" physiological
 422: functioning has yet to be determined, but we do know that almost
 423: all investigators reporting on vegans report them as being above
 424: average in health and more active.
 425: 
 426: 
 427: FINAL WORD:
 428: 
 429: Look, I don't wish to deter any adult vegans from taking B12
 430: supplements.  They certainly can't do any harm and one doesn't
 431: have to take them that often.  Better to err, even if it is
 432: needless error, on the side of caution.  Also, there are now
 433: plenty of B-12 fortified foods.
